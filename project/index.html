        <h1>We Run Rivers to Relax</h1>
        <p>We believe that there is nothing like a river trip for relaxing.
            That is why we subscribe to the dry oar philosophy of boating.<br>
            Keeping your oars dry for us means taking time to look around
            and notice the beauty that surrounds the rivers we love.</p>

        <h2>We Run Whitewater for the Rush</h2>
        <p>That doesn't mean we don't also like rapids.
            Opposites in all things after all. We believe that that
            tenseness that comes when you are<br>
            looking down the tongue of a big string of waves makes you appreciate the calm
            beautiful water that always follows even more.</p>
