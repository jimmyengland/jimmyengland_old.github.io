        <p>My name is Jimmy England, I grew up in the Central Valley in California but currently live in Orange County CA.<br>
            I serverd a mission in Denver, CO<br>
            I work in the film industry as a compositor, which is the person who deals with the green screens and stuff like that. <br>
            I am currently working on a degree in programming so that I can further my career or switch depending on how the industry is when I finish.<br> 
            I married my wife in September of 2018 and I am really enjoying married life. Here is a picture of us!  </p>
