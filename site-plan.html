        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to convey our services, locations and pricing. Our services include daily, weekly, or two week long rafting experiences. 
            These experiences include a guide, meals, and camping equipment if going for multiple days.
            We offer services in these western states, California, Organ, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, and New Mexico.
            Pricing is $100 per person per day. 
        </p>
        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My Audience is outdoors people that are willing to spend money on a good experience. A great target is the boyscouts as they enjoy rafting and camping.
            so it should be geared towards groups of teenagers as well as middle aged men. We should also target family get togthers since it would be a good single day
            experience to have fun and not have to worry about meals or where they are going. It would be good to have pictures of boyscout troops as well as familys.
        </p>

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <h4>Heading Font:Lucida Sans Unicode</h4>
        <p>I think that it makes for a nice clean and readable title</p>
        <h4>Paragraph Font: Helvetica</h4>
        <p>I have always been a fan of Helvetica becuase the kerning is good and very readable</p>
        <h4>Normal paragraph example</h4>
